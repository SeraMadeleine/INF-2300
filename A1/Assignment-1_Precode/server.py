class MyTCPHandler(socketserver.StreamRequestHandler):
    """
    This class is responsible for handling a request. The whole class is
    handed over as a parameter to the server instance so that it is capable
    of processing request. The server will use the handle-method to do this.
    It is instantiated once for each request!
    Since it inherits from the StreamRequestHandler class, it has two very
    usefull attributes you can use:

    rfile - This is the whole content of the request, displayed as a python
    file-like object. This means we can do readline(), readlines() on it!

    wfile - This is a file-like object which represents the response. We can
    write to it with write(). When we do wfile.close(), the response is
    automatically sent.

    The class has three important methods:
    handle() - is called to handle each request.
    setup() - Does nothing by default, but can be used to do any initial
    tasks before handling a request. Is automatically called before handle().
    finish() - Does nothing by default, but is called after handle() to do any
    necessary clean up after a request is handled.

        This method is responsible for handling an http-request. You can, and should(!),
        make additional methods to organize the flow with which a request is handled by
        this method. But it all starts here!
